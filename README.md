# DBBackupUtility
This Python script automates the backup process for MySQL and MariaDB databases. It creates backups of the specified database at regular intervals, stores them locally, and optionally uploads them to GitHub and Discord. It helps ensure that you have an up-to-date backup of your database and can easily restore or share it.
